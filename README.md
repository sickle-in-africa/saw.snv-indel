(SAW) SNV INDEL
===============

Concept
-------
A variant caller for human whole genome sequence data that focuses on SNVs and small indels only. The workflow is designed for case/control studies in medical genetics and optimized for cohorts of African ancestry.

Containerization of the necessary tools is handled by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) where acess can be provided by [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov) and workflow management is handled with [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).
